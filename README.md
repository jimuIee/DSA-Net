# DSA-Net
The DSANet is based on an one-stage object detection framework, which ensures the network to meet the real-time detection requirement. And a dual spatial attention module (DSAM) is proposed to further concentrate on the local neighbor features and the global long-distance information, thus improving the accuracy of underwater sonar object detection.
